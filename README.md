# Overview

This is my first time stretching myself to learn to code in Java in two weeks. I made a simple currency converter using current exchange rates. This project stretched me to become comfortable with Java's Object Oriented programming style. 

Installing Java on VS Code was a really big roadblock for me, but I got there eventually. I struggled at first getting Java to run and even a simple "Hello World" message to display, but now I have functional currency conversion calculator.

# Future Work

* I've hit a roadblock with the GUI window and I think I am using an outdated library. I need to find something newer for the display
* I also want to use an API to get more accurate exchange rates
